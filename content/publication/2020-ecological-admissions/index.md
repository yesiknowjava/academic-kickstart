abstract: "Sir: Meinhofer et al. 1 analyzes administrative data from state medical marijuana laws and substance use treatment admissions in an ecological study design to show that medical marijuana laws are associated with state‐level increases in marijuana, alcohol and cocaine treatment admissions among pregnant women. While these findings are provocative, the utility of ecological analyses in assessing the effects of medical marijuana use is severely limited and this study's results could reflect bias, rather than an individual‐level effect.

Ecological studies are susceptible to a bias commonly referred to as the ‘ecological fallacy’—the (often implied) assumption that correlations occurring at the population‐level parallel correlations at the individual level 2. This assumption is sometimes true, but not always; indeed, correlations that exist when analysing population‐level data may not exist or may even be reversed when analysing individual‐level data. Researchers must use individual‐level data to reliably discern the individual‐level effect of medical marijuana use, an individual‐level exposure.

Concern over the ecological fallacy in studies correlating medical marijuana laws with population‐level have been expressed several times in the research literature 3-7, and this study invokes the same concern. As an ecological study using state‐level data, Meinhofer et al. 1 should not be used as evidence that an individual's medical marijuana use is correlated with an increased likelihood that the individual enters substance use treatment.

Why, then, are ecological studies still regularly published? First, not all ecological analyses are inappropriate. For example, when an exposure universally affects the population of interest (e.g. almost all cigarette smokers are affected by cigarette tax increases), an ecological study may reliably capture increases in individual risk. This is generally not the case for medical marijuana; only approximately 2.5% of adults in medical marijuana states actually use medical marijuana, and the rest are unlikely to experience significant health benefits or consequences from medical marijuana legalization 8. The present study's focus on marijuana treatment admissions may strengthen the reliability of its results, as marijuana users are probably disproportionately affected by marijuana‐related laws; however, the exposure is probably still far from universal.

Further, some argue that ecological studies act as preliminary evidence to provoke further individual‐level investigation. However, marijuana researchers should be cognizant that (a) lay people may not be equipped to discern preliminary evidence from conclusive results in peer‐reviewed studies and (b) advocates on both sides of the medical marijuana debate often disseminate study headlines that support their viewpoint (regardless of study rigour and usually omitting any limitations). Consequently, marijuana researchers should take care to clearly communicate the limitations of their work or, failing that, choose not to publish such preliminary results.

In this case, researchers, policymakers and the public should be well informed that the population‐level correlation observed between medical marijuana laws and substance use treatment admission may reflect bias and the ecological fallacy, rather than the effects of medical marijuana use."
