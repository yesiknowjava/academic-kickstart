abstract: "One of the greatest threats to the validity and reliability of drug
policy research studies is the selective inclusion of controls.
Policies are not formulated in a vacuum, and the inclusion of a rich,
comprehensive array of demographic controls reduces the
possibility that a correlation in the data is better explained by
endogenous factors than the studied independent variable.
Whether intentional or not, exclusion (or inclusion) of controls
can make spurious relationships appear significant (or vice versa).
This issue is important in studies of drug policy as demographics
contribute significantly to usage rates and attitudes (Kandel, Chen,
Warner, Kessler, & Grant, 1997).

However, in drug policy studies, there is significant and often
unexplained variability in the demographic controls included in
statistical models. Most recent American studies use well-known,
publicly available datasets (oftentimes from the U.S. Census
Bureau) with reliable, uniformly reported data for demographic
controls, and yet different researchers routinely choose different
controls without explanation.

As part of a research project, I recently reviewed the literature
related to American counties with restrictive, semi-restrictive, or
non-restrictive alcohol sale laws, often referred to as dry, moist, or
wet counties. As expected, virtually every published study
included a statistical model with demographic controls. Demo-
graphic controls represent subjective and fundamental assump-
tions of an empirical study, and one could expect that a certain set
of demographic controls would be included uniformly in virtually
all studies related to this specific topic. Indeed, certain demo-
graphic controls, such as population density and percent of people
who belong to religious institutions, were included in virtually all
the published studies I reviewed. However, the inclusion of other
controls, such as political party affiliation, was inconsistent.
Political party affiliation was included as a control in some studies
(see, for example, Anderson, Crost, & Rees, 2014; Billings, 2014;
Brown, Jewell, & Richer, 1996; Frendreis & Tatalovich, 2010;
Gotwalt, 2008) and not in others (see, for example, Stewart, Reese,
& Brewer, 2004), and no study I read provided a compelling reason
for the variability. Despite the promise of one author (Billings,
2014) who included political party affiliation as a control that “the
motivation for most of these [control] variables [including political
party affiliation] is based on existing literature,” two of the studies
he referenced, Gyimah-Brempong (2001) and Brown et al. (1996),
did not include political affiliation as a control and the third,
Baughman, Conlin, Dickert-Conlin, and Pepper (2001), provided an
unsatisfying explanation for why political affiliation was included
as a control, which was itself contingent upon other control
variables: “The percentage of voters registered in each political
party is typically used to measure voter ideology or sentiment not
reflected in other taste variables.”

In the same research project, I replicated the results of one of
the most well-publicized drug policy studies of 2015, which found
that, after controlling for a rich array of demographic factors, wet
counties in Kentucky had a significantly higher incidence of meth
lab seizures and meth production (Fernandez, Gohmann, &
Pinkston, 2015). The study’s results received national and
international attention and were featured in The Wall Street
Journal, The Economist, and The Washington Post. The authors of
the study provided me with the data and code used for five of their
OLS statistical models for replication purposes. However, the
model in their study did not control for political affiliation. When I
controlled for percent of the population registered Democrat
(using publicly available, county-level panel data from the
Kentucky Department of State), the study’s results were no longer
statistically significant - political affiliation better explained
variability of meth lab seizures than county alcohol policy (see
Table 1). This result is not due to collinearity of existing controls
with political affiliation; the variance inflation factor (VIF) score, a
measurement of multicollinearity, for political affiliation was less
than 2 (while 5 is considered a conservative threshold and the
average VIF of the originally included controls is greater than 7).

Like the authors of several other studies, the Fernandez team did
not include an explanation for why political affiliation was excluded.
Yet, a reader cannot agree with the results of the study without
agreeing to the authors’ premise in excluding political affiliation - a
logical gap which could easily be overlooked by policy makers or
reporters, especially considering that political affiliation is not
mentioned in the paper as a possible control. Of course, biased
authors in the future may exploit similar opportunities to support
correlations that are, in truth, due to a confounding variable.

I propose that seasoned researchers develop a list of demo-
graphic controls to be regularly included in American drug policy
studies and that peer-reviewers make a point to question authors
of the reasoning behind the inclusion/exclusion of those listed
controls. This step would not coerce authors to include controls
that are irrelevant to their specific study, rather to explicate their
assumptions for why excluded controls are, indeed, irrelevant."
